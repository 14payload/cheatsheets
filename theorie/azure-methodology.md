# Vocabulary

## Azure Key Vault 
Azure Key Vaults are places where encrypted secrets can stored.

## Conditional Access Policies
Fine-grained controls for access to resources and when or where MFA is applied.

## Enterprise
The Enterprise represents the Azure global unique identity that a company owns and allows access to subscriptions, tenants and services.

## Managed Identity
A Managed Identity is a Service Principal of a special type that may only be used with Azure resources. Managed Identities can be used to access Azure Key Vaults and storage accounts.

## Resource
A Resource can be an account, run-book, virtual network, application, etc.

## Runbook
A Runbook is part of the Azure Automation service. It supports scripting languages like PowerShell or Python.

## Storage Account
An Azure storage account can contain all sort of Azure Storage data objects, including blobs, file shares, queues, tables, and disks.

## Subscriptions
Describes how you gain access to an Azure service.

## System-Assigned Managed Identity
Once a resource has been deleted the SAMI will be deleted too.

## Tenant
A Tenant is an instance of an Enterprise. An Enterprise can have multiple tenants (like domains in a forest).

## User-Assigned Managed Identity
Once a resource has been deleted the UAMI won't not be deleted. UAMI can be used on multiple resources.


# Azure AD Connect Methods

## Password Hash Synchronization
Using the Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) the passwords from on-premise AD are sent to the cloud. This is done using a specific service account that has similar rights like DCSync.

## Pass Through Authentication
Using the Pass Through Authentication (PTA) the passwords are kept on-premise and an on-premise agent validates the authentication.

## Active Directory Federation Services
Using the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Azure AD is set as a trusted agent for federation and allows to login with on-premise credentials.

## Verify if the target company uses Azure AD
https://login.microsoftonline.com/getuserrealm.srf?login=<targetMail>
https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray

```
Check 'NameSpaceType' value:

Managed -> O365 is in use
Federated = Federated Active Directory
Unknown = Record does not exist

python3 o365spray.py --validate --domain <targetDomain>
```

## Verify email addresses
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/GetCredentialType
https://github.com/dievus/Oh365UserFinder
https://github.com/LMGsec/o365creeper

```
python3 Oh365UserFinder.py -r <emailFile> -w <output> -t <seconds>

o365creeper.py -f <emailsFile> -o <validEmailsFile>
```

## Basic Azure Storage Url
```
<storageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net
```

## Authenticated user enumeration and Password Spraying
